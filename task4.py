"""
the file task04.txt contains a matrix of values
The row indicates the level of fighter. Row 1 is for a level 1 fighter, row 2 is for a level 2 fighter and so on

In each row, the numers indicate the target number needed out of 20 to land a hit on a specific Armor Class, starting with
10 on the left, followed by 9, then 8, all the way to -10 on the far right.

Create a function that reads the specific value for a specific level and an armor class, and prints the target number needed.
